# Rollbar Ember Example

This is a simple example showing how to track errors in Ember.js with [Rollbar](https://rollbar.com). It's based on the [Ember Starter Kit](https://github.com/emberjs/starter-kit).

Application code, including the Rollbar-Ember instrumentation, is in `js/app.js`. To run:

1. Start up an http server in this project's root directory: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080`
2. Open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser
